# cpp_data_structures
A custom implementation of data structures in C++. Data structures are all taken from the standard C++ library and initial implementation is to follow the specs of the STL data structures. Later plans are to optimize the containers for primarily time, if possible for space as well.

---

## Data Structure Mappings
- std::vector&lt;T&gt; ==> custom::vec&lt;T&gt;
- std::list&lt;T&gt; ==> custom::linked_list&lt;T&gt;
- std::stack&lt;T&gt; ==> custom::stack&lt;T&gt;
- std::queue&lt;T&gt; ==> custom::queue&lt;T&gt;
- std::priority_queue ==> custom::heap&lt;T&gt; (possible add on a binary tree implementation of the priority queue as well)
- std::unordered_map&lt;T,T&gt; ==> custom::hash_map&lt;T,T&gt;
